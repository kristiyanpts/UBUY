# ‚òÅ Hosting Information

You can check out the project at: [https://ubuy-react.netlify.app/](https://ubuy-react.netlify.app/)

You can check out the Back-End REST API at: [https://github.com/kristiyanpts/UBUY-REST-API](https://github.com/kristiyanpts/UBUY-REST-API)

**IMPORTANT**

Back-End REST API is hosted on Render with a free plan that has some limitations. If you get a blank error when you enter the website or courses aren't loading, please wait for up to 2 minutes and refresh. The reason for that is due to the host being free and if not used recently it spins down.
